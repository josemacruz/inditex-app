# Inditex App

## Installation

```bash
npm ci
```

## API Integration

The required API for integration is unavailable, so a simulated API was created using `json-server`. The `db.json` file holds the products data that will be returned by the simulated API.

If you need additional information, the [json-server repository](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) is attached.

## Usage

Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```
